500","methodology":"<p>Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years' data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spinoff is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks and savings institutions are interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses<strong>,<\/strong> but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2014.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2013 profits to 2014 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Balance Sheet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Assets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Earnings Per Share<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Return to Investors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2014 of stock owned at the end of 2004, 2009, and 2013. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spinoffs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes.<\/p>\n<p>Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Medians<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2013 to 2014 do not include companies that lost money in 2013 or lost money in both 2013 and 2014, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Richard K. Tucksmith and Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, she used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S&amp;P Capital IQ to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Edith Fried reviewed and edited nonstatistical information. Researchers Viki Goldman and Kathleen Lyons assisted with the data gathering and verification. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S&amp;P Capital IQ.

In 2014, under new CEO Doug McMillon, Wal-Mart&#8217;s U.S. finally broke a nearly two-year streak of growth-free quarters on the comparable sales front. But that recovery is tenuous: it is still struggling to get people into its stores, and it has suffered from out-of-stocks and customer service that many find wanting. Last year saw a lot of turmoil: it replaced the CEO of its $288 billion U.S. division and lost its chief merchant. But the company has made strides in improving the quality of fresh food in its stores\u2014about 55% of revenue comes from grocery. Its e-commerce investments are paying off too. Still, Wal-Mart is grappling with ever more aggressive rivals like Target and Amazon, the proliferation of dollar stores and a desire for healthier grocery offerings, meaning 2015 is a key year for McMillon to prove he can modernize Wal-Mart.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4273076161001","title":"How Walmart is continuing to grow","author":"Fortune Video","date":"June 4, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/06\/04\/how-walmart-is-continuing-to-grow\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/wal06-15_mcmillon_2015.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"1\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4273076161001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4273076161001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1M5eEvU\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbrianokeefe%2Cdougmcmillon%2Cfortune500%2Cwalmart%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dfortune500&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"2646"},"facebook":{"title":"Walmart","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Walmart on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Walmart employees Iliana Sanchez (C) and her fellow employees stock the shelves at a Walmart store in Miami, Florida.

That became especially apparent in May with its $12.7 billion purchase of Omnicare, a drug delivery company that also helps senior-living centers manage residents&#8217; medications. The purchase, its largest since 2007 when it paid $21.7 billion for pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx, gives the retailer greater strategic reach as it looks to serve an aging population with greater care needs. The Omnicare deal builds on a grander shift managed by CEO Larry Merlo, transforming the drug store chain into a full-service health management company. Within the last year, the company swept cigarettes off its shelves, changed its name to CVS Health from CVS Caremark and made plans to expand its in-store health clinics by about 600 locations by 2017. The moves position CVS Health, which operates about 7,700 retail pharmacies and 900 walk-in clinics, as an equipped provider for patients.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"4680"},"facebook":{"title":"CVS Health","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"CVS Health on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"The inside of a CVS store in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The San Francisco-based firm finally acquired the full company at the beginning of last year and has been busy integrating the new purchase. In addition to its health care distribution business, McKesson also develops, implements and supports software within the medical community, which is often underappreciated relative to the company&#8217;s larger distribution unit. Its technology solutions segment is on pace to bring in more than $3 billion in 2015, making it the industry&#8217;s No. 2 leader to Cerner.

Their businesses don&#8217;t stop there. CEO Stephen Hemsley has been investing heavily in Optum, its health services arm that includes a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and health data analytics. While Optum represents only a third of the Minnesota-based company&#8217;s total revenues, the unit is growing fast. To bolster Optum&#8217;s pharmacy business, UnitedHealth acquired Catamaran for $12.8 billion in March, which more than doubled its PBM members to 65 million. The additional scale gives UnitedHealth more sway when it comes to negotiating drug prices with manufacturers. While drug spending has been relatively stable in recent years as generics replaced blockbuster drugs, the rise of specialty drugs for diseases like high cholesterol and hepatitis C has put increased pressure on PMBs to help employers rein in costs. Drug discounts are also beneficial for PMBs, including UnitedHealth, which keep a portion of the discounts they obtain from drug makers\u2014sometimes as much as 15% of the negotiated rebates.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1720"},"facebook":{"title":"UnitedHealth Group","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"UnitedHealth Group on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"UnitedHealthcare's sign outside a store in Queens, New York.

At its investor&#8217;s day earlier this year, CEO Jamie Dimon remarked how dog friendly its branches are. (Free dog biscuits.) It&#8217;s all part of a plan to make the financial behemoth seem simple. But JPMorgan is actually pretty complicated. It has the largest derivatives trading book on Wall Street, and is a big player in repos, a lending market few see, but is a key part of the plumbing of the financial system. Dimon is slimming down Chase&#8217;s complicated, and thanks to increased regulations, less profitable Wall Street businesses. That hurt sales, which were down 4% in 2014, but investors are happy and earnings are up (though the later is mostly due to fewer financial crisis-related fines). The moves have also held off critics who say the bank should be broken up. For now, Dimon&#8217;s empire, one of the most profitable in the financial sector, appears safely intact.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"3447317926001","title":"Dimon: Road back to normal \u2018scary\u2019","author":"Geoff Colvin","date":"June 7, 2013","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2013\/06\/07\/dimon-road-back-to-normal-scary\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/06\/jamie-dimon.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"9\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3447317926001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3447317926001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1FV9q7I\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dfortune500%2Cjamiedimon%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dfortune500&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"JP Morgan Chase","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"JP Morgan Chase on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Photograph by Ron Antonelli \u2014 Getty Images","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/460196576.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/jpm\/","location":"New York, NY","industry":"Commercial Banks","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"jpm","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/jpmorgan.png?w=73","term":{"term_id":749760,"name":"JPMORGAN CHASE","slug":"jpm","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":22946,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":1252,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":"JP Morgan Chase (JPM) Stock Price, Financials and News | Fortune 500"},"rank":21,"order":21,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2015\/jp-morgan-chase\/","prev_rank":18,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1G2jn1f","uri":"\/fortune500\/2015\/jp-morgan-chase\/","sort":{"rank":"21","revchange":"-3.9","profits":"21762","prftchange":"21.4","assets":"2573126","employees":"241359","mktval":"225861"},"swot":{"strengths":["As the biggest bank in the nation, JPMorgan would still qualify for a bailout if it were to run into trouble.","The best of the megabanks is using its position as the nation's largest lender to take market share in other financial markets, like underwriting stock sales or advising on mergers."],"weaknesses":["Chase has struggled to stay out of trouble.

In March, Cardinal shelled out $1.94 billion to acquire Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Cordis heart-product business, which allows Cardinal to add stents and catheters to the products it offers its clients. The deal follows on the heels of Cardinal&#8217;s long-term strategic agreement with Henry Schein in November 2014 and a contract manufacturing agreement with Bayer Healthcare during the second fiscal quarter this year. The partnerships and purchases are a way for Cardinal to expand its portfolio of medical products that it sells to hospitals, physicians and ambulatory centers. It&#8217;s also further expanding into added services and support for customers that are moving from the traditional hospital model to larger integrated systems across various sites of

Only a year into his role as CEO, Satya Nadella seems to have injected innovation into the once stale company, recently debuting the company&#8217;s big bet on virtual reality and gaming, the Hololens. Despite competition from Apple&#8217;s iPad, Microsoft&#8217;s tablet business Surface continues to grow and shows signs of being the company&#8217;s next billion dollar business. As more enterprises look to the cloud to power their businesses, Microsoft&#8217;s commercial cloud business is booming, with revenue growing by 128 percent in Q1 2015.

The Indianapolis-based company&#8217;s database was penetrated by a hacker attack that was revealed in early 2015, affecting 78.8 million people. The attack exposed names, birthdays, Social Security numbers and other personal data, though there&#8217;s still no evidence that any medical data or financial information was breached. Anthem, the second-biggest health insurer in the U.S., has been working to contain the breach and inform affected patients while facing an onslaught of lawsuits related to the incursion. Despite the security breach, Anthem&#8217;s enrollment growth has continued higher. In the first three months this year, the group added 1 million more patients to reach a total of 38.5 million members. The growing member base combined with a lower medical-cost trend has boosted earnings in recent months, which CEO Joseph Swedish expects to continue through the rest of the year.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"2619"},"facebook":{"title":"Anthem","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Anthem on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Anthem offered to buy Cigna for $45 billion.","credit":"Photograph by Aaron P.

The pay raise, which follows similar moves by Wal-Mart and McDonald&#8217;s, will affect 5,700 of Aetna&#8217;s lowest-paid workers. Even as the health insurance industry has been rocked by the Affordable Care Act\u2014in both good and bad ways\u2014Bertolini believes the move is good business, largely paying for itself by making workers more productive. Like its rival insurers, Aetna has benefited from higher enrollments driven by the ACA but has also faced new fees imposed by the act that took effect in 2014. The Hartford, Conn.-based company&#8217;s membership stood at 23.7 million as of the end of the first quarter in 2015, a 1 million member boost year-over-year. Aetna has also benefited from the broader trend in lower health costs as of late. Its medical benefit ratio, the percentage of premiums used to pay medical costs, fell to 79.1% as of the beginning of 2015, down from 80.4% a year earlier. Aetna said medical cost trend would remain &#8220;moderate&#8221; for the year due to less utilization of medical services by members and better deals on expensive specialty drugs.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4618229094001","title":"Aetna CEO: Consumers Shouldn\u2019t Worry About Healthcare Mergers","author":"saralson","date":"November 17, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/11\/17\/aetna-mark-bertolini\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/11\/gettyimages-462018166.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"19\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4618229094001-19\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4618229094001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1PMXI1v\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daetna%2Caetnaandhumana%2Caetnaceo%2Chealthcaremergers%2Chumana%2Cmarkbertolini%2Cmedicade%2Cmedicare%2Cmergersandacquisitions%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Daetna&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"2807"},"facebook":{"title":"Aetna","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Aetna on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Aetna runners, walkers and employee volunteers support the Komen Connecticut Race for the Cure in Hartford.","credit":"Courtesy of  Aetna","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=462&h=260&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg?w=462&h=260&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/aetna.jpeg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/aet\/","location":"Hartford, CT","industry":"Health Care: Insurance and Managed Care","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"aet","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/aetna.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":6633826,"name":"AETNA INC.","slug":"aet","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":63921,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":165,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":"Aetna (AET) Stock Price, Financials and News | Fortune 500"},"rank":49,"order":49,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2015\/aetna\/","prev_rank":57,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1kTAWty","uri":"\/fortune500\/2015\/aetna\/","sort":{"rank":"49","revchange":"22.6","profits":"2041","prftchange":"6.6","assets":"53402","employees":"48800","mktval":"37147"},"swot":{"strengths":["Well-respected CEO","The company has shown positive earnings-per-share growth over the past two years and is on track to continue that trend in 2015."],"weaknesses":["Aetna currently lacks a strong ability to negotiate specialty drug prices.","The company is looking for ways to move cost of specialty drugs from medical benefit into pharmacy benefit for better leverage."],"opportunities":["Increased productivity from higher paid employees.","Aetna has added more than 950,000 members through ACA exchanges.

Machinery, energy, and transportation sales for the year were the third highest in Caterpillar&#8217;s 90-year history, though overall revenue dipped for the second consecutive year from a high in 2012, and operating profit was down as well. Profit per share rose by 13 cents year-over-year to $5.88, which was down by nearly three dollars from its $8.48 high in 2012. The declines are an effect of the steep decline in oil prices, since oil and mining companies (Caterpillar&#8217;s biggest clients) have invested less in new manufacturing equipment.

Health insurers, including Louisville, Ky.-based Humana, are facing a 4% reduction in payment rates for Medicare Advantage programs this year, though relief is on the horizon. The U.S. government said it would increase payments by 1.25% in 2016, reversing an earlier proposal that would have cut payments yet again. That will help Humana&#8217;s bottom line, which has been squeezed recently by operating expenses that grew 18.7% year-over-year as of the start of 2015. Humana has been working with the U.S. government on its new value-based care initiatives, which would tie reimbursements for doctors and hospitals to quality outcomes. The Department of Health and Human Services is aiming to transition 30% of traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare payments to value-based payment models by the end of 2016. Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said about 55% of the company&#8217;s members are connected to doctors using some form of this reimbursement standard, which has lowered costs 20% among those members.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"4257"},"facebook":{"title":"Humana","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Humana on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Humana employees at our Digital Experience Center.

The technology company established its dominance as a provider of software and databases for enterprise data centers. Last year, Oracle surpassed IBM to become the world&#8217;s second-largest software vendor by pulling in US $29.6 billion in software sales in 2013. But as more and more companies are using the cloud to power computing software and applications, Oracle is now shifting its software strategy and will make all of its software available to download in a subscription model from the internet come this fall. There&#8217;s a good reason for his move: revenue from the company&#8217;s cloud software products rose 29% in Oracle&#8217;s Q3 earnings earlier this year. And according to the company, Oracle is on track to sell more than $1 billion of new cloud subscriptions this fiscal year.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4275640149001","title":"Mark Hurd: From scandal at HP to Oracle co-CEO","author":"Stephen Valdivia","date":"June 8, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/06\/08\/mark-hurd-from-scandal-at-hp-to-oracle-co-ceo\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/01\/hur06-15-1080x720.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"29\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4275640149001-29\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4275640149001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1czOkxX\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/features_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dfortune500%2Chewlettpackard%2Chp%2Churd%2Cmarkhurd%2Coracle%26ch%3Dfeatures%26topic%3Dfortune500&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1028"},"facebook":{"title":"Oracle","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Oracle on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Photograph by Justin Sullivan \u2014 Getty Images","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/gettyimages-460559836.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/orcl\/","location":"Redwood City, CA","industry":"Computer Software","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"orcl","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/oracle.png?w=73","term":{"term_id":238348521,"name":"ORACLE CORP.","slug":"orcl","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":31543,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":777,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":"Oracle (ORCL) Stock Price, Financials and News | Fortune 500"},"rank":81,"order":81,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2015\/oracle\/","prev_rank":82,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1G2k8HD","uri":"\/fortune500\/2015\/oracle\/","sort":{"rank":"81","revchange":"2.9","profits":"10955","prftchange":"0.3","assets":"90344","employees":"122000","mktval":"188439"},"swot":{"strengths":["Restructured its sales force and compensation three years ago to focus on selling cloud software","Cloud software business is growing"],"weaknesses":["Cloud-based software business is filled with worthy competitors including Workday, Salesforce, Microsoft and others.",""],"opportunities":["","Instead of building subscription software in house, the company could acquire growing cloud software providers.

As a result, research and development remained steady in 2014 at $1.5 billion.

Sales were up a meager 4% last year, about half of the company&#8217;s goal. This year could likely be disappointing as well.

Ken Chenault is trying to replace the lost Costco users and expand the company beyond its traditionally affluent and corporate customer base. AmEx has been offering prepaid debt cards, which often appeal to people who don&#8217;t have access to a traditional bank account. AmEx is also striking up relationships with McDonald&#8217;s and Wal-mart in order to reach more everyday spending.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"3447034032001","title":"AmEx CEO and Sheryl Sandberg on

Like other health insurers, Cigna is gaining more individual customers as a result of the Affordable Care Act. The Bloomfield, Conn.-based insurer has also benefited from higher premiums and fees, gaining 12.3% over the first three months this year. Cigna teamed up with Catamaran in 2013 to manage its drug benefits and has recently been reaping the benefits. The deal has already boosted earnings per share by 50 cents last year and another 10 cents to 15 cents gain is expected in 2015.

The company has seen net income dip in recent years, however, while competition with DISH has increased. Being under the umbrella of a company as large as AT&amp;T should help. But companies like Netflix have also become increasingly vocal against the provider. The online streaming service asked the Federal Communications Commission in 2015 to reject the merger.
