500","methodology":"<p>Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2018. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2016 profits to 2017 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Balance Sheet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Assets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Earnings Per Share<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Return to Investors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2017 of stock owned at the end of 2007, 2012, and 2016. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spin-offs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Medians<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2016 to 2017 do not include companies that lost money in 2016 or lost money in both 2016 and 2017, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialist Rhona Altschuler. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, we used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence to calculate total return and market capitalization.

target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> cracked the top 10 for the first time, continuing its remarkable growth run: Sales have jumped some $70 billion in two years. Amazon&#8217;s enormity stems from its role as the largest U.S. digital retailer, the fastest-growing part of the market. Two other major factors drive the company&#8217;s growth: Expansion abroad to markets like India and the rise of Amazon Web Services, the company&#8217;s market-leading online storage and service operation. Amazon spends heavily to boost those sales: Faster delivery, robust entertainment, and robot-enabled warehouses are part of its increasingly ambitious plans. Amazon also began a North American competition for a second headquarters.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Amazon.com","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Amazon.com on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Stack of Amazon Prime boxes, USA","credit":"Jeramey Lende \u2014 Alamy Stock ","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/amazon-com-fortune-500.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/amzn\/","location":"Seattle","industry":"Internet Services and Retailing","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"amzn","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/amazon.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":20130615,"name":"AMAZON INC.","slug":"amzn","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":64969,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":5650,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":8,"order":8,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2018\/amazon-com\/","prev_rank":12,"shortlink":"https:\/\/for.tn\/2scRG64","uri":"\/fortune500\/2018\/amazon-com\/","sort":{"rank":"8","revenues":"177866.00","revchange":"30.8","profits":"3033.00","prftchange":"27.9","assets":"131310.00","mktval":"700667.70","rankchange1000":"4","employees":"566000","rankchange":"4"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"tempo_hero_video":null,"slug":"amazon-com","franchise_list_id":"2358051","ranking":"8","ordering":"8","epschange":"25.5","prevrank":"12","eps10yr":"18.6","fullname":"Amazon.com, Inc.","totrti10yr":"28.9","fn_company":"Acquired Whole Foods Market (2016 rank: 176), Aug. 28, 2017.","prftchange":"27.9","revenues":"177866.00","revchange":"30.8","profits":"3033.00","assets":"131310.00","totshequity":"27709.00","totrti5yr":"36.1","mktval":"700667.70","eps":"6.15","prftpctseqty":"10.9","rankchange1000":"4","employees":"566000","guid":"10810","rankchange":"4","prftpctsls":"1.7","prftpctasts":"2.3","ticker":"AMZN","totrti":"56","sector":"Retailing","industry":"Internet Services and Retailing","hqlocation":"Seattle","hqaddr":"410 Terry Ave. N.","hqcity":"Seattle","hqstate":"WA","hqzip":"98109","hqtel":"206-266-1000","ceo":"Jeffrey P.

Instead it will focus on more profitable vehicles like trucks, SUVs, and crossovers. It&#8217;s a splashy move for CEO Jim Hackett&#8211;who has been on the job for just one year&#8211;but drastic, profit-maximizing decisions are how he made his reputation as CEO of office furniture-maker Steelcase. Like other major carmakers, Ford is waiting for a series of bets on alternative fuels, autonomous driving, and ridesharing to pay off.

While the consumer banking titan emerged from 2008 relatively unscathed, new CEO Tim Sloan spent 2017 issuing apology after apology. After losing consumer confidence for creating 2.1 million fake accounts a year earlier, Wells Fargo admitted in 2017 that an additional 1.7 million fake accounts had been made. The bank also admitted that it had charged as many as 570,000 consumers for unneeded auto insurance. And, further tarnishing its &#8220;golden child&#8221; moniker, Wells Fargo revealed a $1 billion charge for previously disclosed regulatory investigations into its pre-crisis mortgage activities.

PepsiCo&#8217;s focus on &#8220;better for you&#8221; and &#8220;good for you&#8221; products led to the launch of veggie chips and new kombucha flavors, but the company&#8217;s core North America soda business took a hit as it admittedly moved too much attention toward its new, healthier goods.

ESPN, once the profit engine for Disney, is now weighing down the company&#8217;s earnings (lower ad revenue and higher programming costs will do that). The Mouse House&#8217;s total 2017 revenue was down 1% from the year before, partly due to declines in its media networks business, which is comprised of ESPN and other networks. On the plus side, Disney&#8217;s parks and resorts business saw an uptick in average guest spending and attendance in 2017. And the entertainment juggernaut has plenty of tricks up its sleeves: Later this year it will launch one of two streaming services, and remove its content from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a>.

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> on the Fortune 500 for the first time since 2012 a year earlier, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a> continued to widen the difference in 2017 with revenue jumping 15%. Those gains come as the banks trading performance beat that of Goldman Sachs&#8217; during the year. But the real star of the show was Morgan Stanley&#8217;s wealth management business. Much like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley has sought to insulate itself from its often volatile trading division since the financial crisis, instead of focusing on steadier forms of revenue, such as businesses based on fees. That&#8217;s where wealth management, which includes Morgan Stanley&#8217;s brokerage and investment advisory services, has come in. While the segment accounted for about 19% of the bank&#8217;s total $29.8 billion revenue in 2006, that figure is now 44% of its $38 billion in revenue. With the continued growth of that division, Morgan Stanley is targeting a return on equity of between 9% to 13% in the near term.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Morgan Stanley","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Morgan Stanley on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Pedestrians pass in front of Morgan Stanley digital signage displayed on the exterior of the company's headquarters in New York, U.S., on Thursday, April 12, 2018.

Long-venerated as a trading powerhouse, Goldman Sachs has struggled to regain its foothold there since the financial crisis.

CEO Lloyd Blankfein also laid a path for what&#8217;s to come after his yet-to-be-announced departure. Despite Blankfein&#8217;s own trading roots, he named David Solomon, a wine-loving DJ with investment banking roots, as sole chief operating officer of the firm in a sign that an heir apparent had been chosen.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Goldman Sachs Group","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Goldman Sachs Group on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Goldman Sachs","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/goldman-sachs-blue-ribbon-companies-2016.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/gs\/","location":"New York City","industry":"Commercial Banks","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"gs","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/goldmansachs.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":73334978,"name":"GOLDMAN SACHS","slug":"gs","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":79600,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":1398,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":70,"order":70,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2018\/goldman-sachs-group\/","prev_rank":78,"shortlink":"https:\/\/for.tn\/2rRjEE2","uri":"\/fortune500\/2018\/goldman-sachs-group\/","sort":{"rank":"70","revenues":"42254.00","revchange":"12","profits":"4286.00","prftchange":"-42.1","assets":"916776.00","mktval":"95462.50","rankchange1000":"8","employees":"36600","rankchange":"8"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"tempo_hero_video":null,"slug":"goldman-sachs-group","franchise_list_id":"2358051","ranking":"70","ordering":"70","epschange":"-44.7","prevrank":"78","eps10yr":"-9.6","eps5yr":"-8.6","fullname":"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","totrti10yr":"3","prftchange":"-42.1","revenues":"42254.00","revchange":"12","profits":"4286.00","assets":"916776.00","totshequity":"82243.00","totrti5yr":"16.4","mktval":"95462.50","eps":"9.01","prftpctseqty":"5.2","rankchange1000":"8","employees":"36600","guid":"10777","rankchange":"8","prftpctsls":"10.1","prftpctasts":"0.5","ticker":"GS","totrti":"7.7","sector":"Financials","industry":"Commercial Banks","hqlocation":"New York City","hqaddr":"200 West St.","hqcity":"New York","hqstate":"NY","hqzip":"10282","hqtel":"212-902-1000","ceo":"Lloyd C.

The big reason: A $1.3 billion increase in fuel costs. That headwind continues to worsen, and it&#8217;s the main reason CEO Doug Parker slightly lowered earnings guidance for 2018. Still, American&#8217;s vaunted network management remains excellent. The Fort Worth-based carrier is both simplifying and expanding its regional operations, adding substantially to its fleet via $1.4 billion in purchases from Embraer and Bombardier.

But <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/delta-air-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\">Delta<\/a> has sustained a far higher level of profitability than archrivals American and United Continental: Its operating margin of 15% reigns as best of the Big Three. Its in-house portfolio of refineries has helped it hold its own in the face of sharply rising fuel costs; Delta&#8217;s jet fuel bill rose 13% in 2017, beating the industry average by around seven points. It also kept a tight rein on wages and benefits, which rose only 4%, in line with revenues, and a new partnership with Aeromexico is off to a strong start. Delta&#8217;s biggest edge is its ability to win rich fares from business travelers. It controls more than 70% of the traffic at four major commercial markets: Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis, and over 50% in Salt Lake City. Its dominance in those hubs shields Delta&#8217;s margins from inroads from budget competitors such as Southwest.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Delta Air Lines","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Delta Air Lines on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Boeing 777-200ER (777) at Technical Operations. -These images are protected by copyright.

The move was the first major shakeup at Honeywell since Adamczyk succeeded David Cote as CEO in April. The company is also benefiting from economic growth in most regions, especially in the U.S., where a corporate tax cut has increased business confidence. The rebounding of oil prices has also helping bolster sales at Honeywell&#8217;s energy-related

&#8220;dragging&#8221; incident where security guards pulled a 69-year old doctor from a flight in April, and an October conference call where CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby shocked investors by failing to address how they&#8217;d improve profitability, and asking for &#8220;patience&#8221; instead. Those mishaps cast doubt on whether United can deliver on a bold strategy. For years, the carrier struggled to integrate reservation systems and schedules from the botched United-Continental merger in 2010. That left United especially vulnerable to super-low fare competition in some critical hubs. United is also fighting to recapture the lucrative corporate customers it lost to American and Delta in many markets. United has pledged to raise capacity as much as 6% in the US this year, an announcement that hammered its stock price. Munoz has made great progress settling labor contracts, and Kirby is a brilliant network planner. But investor fret that expanded capacity will flood United&#8217;s routes with seats, further depressing prices and margins, without wooing back business customers.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"United Continental Holdings","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"United Continental Holdings on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"new uniform shoot IAH","credit":"Courtesy of United","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/united-fortune-500.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/ual\/","location":"Chicago","industry":"Airlines","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"ual","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/united-continental-holdings_416x4161.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":237404570,"name":"UNITED CONTINENTAL HLDG","slug":"ual","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":103458,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":338,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":81,"order":81,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2018\/united-continental-holdings\/","prev_rank":83,"shortlink":"https:\/\/for.tn\/2sPmw1q","uri":"\/fortune500\/2018\/united-continental-holdings\/","sort":{"rank":"81","revenues":"37736.00","revchange":"3.2","profits":"2131.00","prftchange":"-5.8","assets":"42326.00","mktval":"19778.10","rankchange1000":"2","employees":"89800","rankchange":"2"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"tempo_hero_video":null,"slug":"united-continental-holdings","franchise_list_id":"2358051","ranking":"81","ordering":"81","epschange":"2.5","prevrank":"83","eps10yr":"9.7","fullname":"United Continental Holdings, Inc.","totrti10yr":"7.2","prftchange":"-5.8","revenues":"37736.00","revchange":"3.2","profits":"2131.00","assets":"42326.00","totshequity":"8806.00","totrti5yr":"23.6","mktval":"19778.10","eps":"7.02","prftpctseqty":"24.2","rankchange1000":"2","employees":"89800","guid":"2102","rankchange":"2","prftpctsls":"5.6","prftpctasts":"5","ticker":"UAL","totrti":"-7.5","sector":"Transportation","industry":"Airlines","hqlocation":"Chicago","hqaddr":"233 S.

unit in February. The deal helped boost revenue 40% in 2017 to a record $36.8 billion and move the company up the food chain from reselling items like phones, PCs, and servers to the more expensive data center equipment. That&#8217;s a smart move by CEO Robert Dutkowsky to follow his customers, as businesses increasingly move from running their own servers to relying on the huge centers run by Amazon, Google, and others. Still, hardware sales hit a road bump over the summer, sending Tech Data&#8217;s stock plunging, and Wall Street remains worried about the business. Change could be coming, however, as 30-year IBM veteran Rich Hume takes over for Dutkowsky as CEO in June.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Tech Data","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Tech Data on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Jake Ford Photography ","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/techdata-supplied_tech_data_sales_053.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/tecd\/","location":"Clearwater, Fla.","industry":"Wholesalers: Electronics and Office Equipment","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"tecd","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/01\/techdata-logo.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":176522565,"name":"TECH DATA","slug":"tecd","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":41410,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":14,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":83,"order":83,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2018\/tech-data\/","prev_rank":107,"shortlink":"https:\/\/for.tn\/2s0KlXE","uri":"\/fortune500\/2018\/tech-data\/","sort":{"rank":"83","revenues":"36775.00","revchange":"40.2","profits":"116.6","prftchange":"-40.2","assets":"12652.60","mktval":"3248.90","rankchange1000":"24","employees":"14000","rankchange":"24"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"tempo_hero_video":null,"slug":"tech-data","franchise_list_id":"2358051","ranking":"83","ordering":"83","epschange":"-44.6","prevrank":"107","eps10yr":"4.5","eps5yr":"-7.5","fullname":"Tech Data Corporation","totrti10yr":"10","fn_company":"Figures are for fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018.","prftchange":"-40.2","revenues":"36775.00","revchange":"40.2","profits":"116.6","assets":"12652.60","totshequity":"2921.50","totrti5yr":"16.6","mktval":"3248.90","eps":"3.05","prftpctseqty":"4","rankchange1000":"24","employees":"14000","guid":"5048","rankchange":"24","prftpctsls":"0.3","prftpctasts":"0.9","ticker":"TECD","totrti":"15.7","sector":"Wholesalers","industry":"Wholesalers: Electronics and Office Equipment","hqlocation":"Clearwater, Fla.","hqaddr":"5350 Tech Data Dr.","hqcity":"Clearwater","hqstate":"FL","hqzip":"33760","hqtel":"727-539-7429","ceo":"Robert M.

target=\"_blank\">Nike<\/a> dropped a spot in this year&#8217;s ranking, the sportswear powerhouse grew its revenue and profit and maintained its status as the world&#8217;s largest supplier of athletic apparel. A sales partnership with Amazon and Instagram also expanded Nike&#8217;s digital reach, much to the chagrin of its brick-and-mortar retail partners. Still, Nike has room for concern. Competition with Adidas, Under Armour and Puma remains fierce, and it looks highly unlikely Nike will hit its ambitious target of $50 billion in sales by 2020. Plus, questions over the company&#8217;s leadership have emerged in recent months. Allegations of harassment and discrimination against Nike&#8217;s female employees resulted in the departures of 11 top level executives, including company president Trevor Edwards, once seen as a potential successor to CEO Mark Edwards&#8211;who is nearing 65 years of age.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Nike","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Nike on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Nike","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2018\/05\/nike-fortune-500.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/nke\/","location":"Beaverton, Ore.","industry":"Apparel","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"nke","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/nike.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":5198219,"name":"NIKE INC.","slug":"nke","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":90995,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":614,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":89,"order":89,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2018\/nike\/","prev_rank":88,"shortlink":"https:\/\/for.tn\/2sPlRNr","uri":"\/fortune500\/2018\/nike\/","sort":{"rank":"89","revenues":"34350.00","revchange":"6.1","profits":"4240.00","prftchange":"12.8","assets":"23259.00","mktval":"108093.90","rankchange1000":"-1","employees":"74400","rankchange":"-1"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"tempo_hero_video":null,"slug":"nike","franchise_list_id":"2358051","ranking":"89","ordering":"89","epschange":"16.2","prevrank":"88","eps10yr":"13.1","eps5yr":"16.2","fullname":"Nike, Inc.","totrti10yr":"16.1","fn_company":"Figures are for fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.","prftchange":"12.8","revenues":"34350.00","revchange":"6.1","profits":"4240.00","assets":"23259.00","totshequity":"12407.00","totrti5yr":"20.8","mktval":"108093.90","eps":"2.51","prftpctseqty":"34.2","rankchange1000":"-1","employees":"74400","guid":"2184","rankchange":"-1","prftpctsls":"12.3","prftpctasts":"18.2","ticker":"NKE","totrti":"24.7","sector":"Apparel","industry":"Apparel","hqlocation":"Beaverton, Ore.","hqaddr":"1 Bowerman Dr.","hqcity":"Beaverton","hqstate":"OR","hqzip":"97005","hqtel":"503-671-6453","ceo":"Mark G.
