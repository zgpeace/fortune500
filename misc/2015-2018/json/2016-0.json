500","methodology":"<p><strong>Methodology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2016. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2015.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2014 profits to 2015 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Balance Sheet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Assets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Earnings Per Share<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Return to Investors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2015 of stock owned at the end of 2005, 2010, and 2014. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spin-offs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Medians<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2014 to 2015 do not include companies that lost money in 2014 or lost money in both 2014 and 2015, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Rhona Altschuler and Kathleen Lyons. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, we used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Larry Shine provided technical support. Researcher Viki Goldman assisted with the data gathering and verification. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

Still the most profitable publicly-traded company in the world, Apple&#8217;s iPhone 6S and 6S Plus upgrades barely outsold their predecessors after arriving on the market at the end of 2015, while sales of the iPad tablet computer continued to shrink throughout the year. In April 2015, the Apple Watch arrived to mixed reviews and modest sales. And though debate raged for a bit about the state of Apple&#8217;s sales in China amid a slowing economy there &#8212; including an unusual August 2015 email from CEO Tim Cook to CNBC host Jim Cramer claiming no summer slowdown &#8212; the year ended on a weak note for the company in Asia.

target=\"_blank\">Ford<\/a> posted its best U.S. sales performance since 2006. The newly revamped F-Series Trucks were a particularly bright spot, with more than 780,000 vehicles sold. The company will look to continue that streak as the market is expected to grow again this year, thanks to low gas prices. The company will also likely continue to push into automated driving technology to keep up with increasing competition. Ford had been in talks with technology companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a> and Uber recently, but ultimately decided not to partner with either. CEO Mark Fields noted that company culture was a big reason for this. Fields has made a lot of noise about his commitment to growing Ford as a tech company, and that should continue as the industry continues to automate.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4158667231001","title":"Ford CEO\u2019s secret to changing the company\u2019s culture","author":"Fortune Video","date":"April 7, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/04\/07\/ford-ceos-secret-to-changing-the-companys-culture\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/mark-fields.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"6\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4158667231001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4158667231001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1CuKL1x\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcontinental%2Cford%2Cleadership%2Clincoln%2Cmarkfields%2Conleading%2Csusiegharib%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Donleading&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1483"},"facebook":{"title":"Ford Motor","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Ford Motor on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"CLAYCOMO, MO.

A continued assault from revitalized wireless carrier T-Mobile helped strip away almost two million of AT&amp;T&#8217;s monthly mobile subscribers. And the old legacy landline phone business accelerated its decline, losing almost 10% of its revenue from the year before. So CEO Randall Stephenson made two bold gambles that may \u2014 or may not \u2014 pay off in coming years. First, he spent almost $50 billion to acquire satellite television provider DirecTV. Along with its existing cable television offering Uverse, the move immediately made AT&amp;T one of the largest TV subscription services in the world with 26 million U.S. customers and 19 million overseas. AT&amp;T also acquired Nextel Mexico and Iusacell for less than $5 billion. Combining the two and upgrading its Mexican infrastructure could pay off if Latin America continues to grow faster than many other parts of the world.

In the process, Immelt is dismantling the legacy of his legendary predecessor, Jack Welch. In early 2015, Immelt and his team made the landmark decision to sell most of GE Capital, the lending business built by Welch that once generated half of the conglomerate\u2019s profits but sank under the heavy regulatory regime adopted following the financial crisis. In just eighteen months, Immelt has sold, or reached agreements to shed, $171 billion of the financial arm\u2019s $200 billion in assets. In mid-January 2016, GE agreed to unload another barely profitable bulwark, its consumer appliance franchise, to Haier of China for $5.4 billion. Immelt is betting heavily on lighting homes and powering plants across the globe; in November, GE acquired the power generation arm of France\u2019s Alstom for $10 billion, greatly strengthening its reach in gas-fired, \u201ccombined cycle\u201d plants that are driving the industry\u2019s growth. So far, the results are mixed. In the first quarter, three GE staples \u2014 jet engines, medical equipment, and power generation \u2014 all showed good revenue growth, while two others, oil and gas, and transportation equipment, including locomotives, dropped sharply. All told GE\u2019s industrial profits fell 7% from the first quarter of 2015.

A year after spending $130 billion to buy out wireless parter Vodafone, CEO Lowell McAdam sought to slim down and pay down some of the over $110 billion of long term debt he accumulated to pull off the buyout. That required selling off profitable but geographically remote landline telephone and FiOS cable television and Internet businesses in California, Texas and Florida to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/frontier-communications\/\" target=\"_blank\">Frontier Communications<\/a> for $10.5 billion. He raised another $5 billion selling off rights to more 11,000 cellular towers. Still, McAdam did need to make a few strategic additions. Verizon has frequently been rated as having the most comprehensive and widespread wireless network in the country but those airwaves have been filling up and getting ever more crowded. So McAdam spent big at the government&#8217;s Advanced Wireless Services spectrum auction, grabbing another 181 licenses. And in a play to move beyond subscription revenue and capture some of the growing digital advertising pie, McAdam snapped up AOL for $4 billion.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1103"},"facebook":{"title":"Verizon","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Verizon on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"A customer browses smartphones in a Verizon Wireless store in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Wednesday, April 15, 2015.

Costco, which benefits from having stores in more affluent areas than Sam&#8217;s does, has been looking to pad its lead by improving its merchandise, particularly fresh food, a key category for getting shoppers into stores. And given how Costco is an e-commerce laggard compared to rivals in terms of offering services like store pickup of online orders, finding ways to promote shopper traffic are essential. Some initiatives have included on-site bread baking at some stores. And its $15 billion-a-year Kirkland store brand is a cash cow that is only growing in popularity. Still, Costco will have to deal with a newly aggressive Sam&#8217;s Club which has made no secret of its intention to go higher end, aiming squarely at Costco&#8217;s customers.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"163225"},"facebook":{"title":"Costco","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Costco on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Costco","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/15costco2.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/cost\/","location":"Issaquah, WA","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Other","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"cost","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/costco.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":4077491,"name":"COSTCO WHOLESALE CORP.","slug":"cost","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":70484,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":266,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":15,"order":15,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/costco-wholesale\/","prev_rank":18,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUS0O","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/costco-wholesale\/","sort":{"rank":"15","revenues":"116199","revchange":"3.2","profits":"2377","prftchange":"15.5","assets":"33440","employees":"161000","mktval":"69183"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"costco-wholesale","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"15","guid":"2649","ordering":"15","hqlocation":"Issaquah, WA","fullname":"Costco Wholesale Corporation","revenues":"116199","revchange":"3.2","profits":"2377","prftchange":"15.5","assets":"33440","totshequity":"10617","prftpctsls":"2","prftpctasts":"7.1","prftpctseqty":"22.4","eps":"5.37","epschange":"15.5","eps5yr":"13","eps10yr":"9.4","totrti":"19","totrti5yr":"21.2","totrti10yr":"15","employees":"161000","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Other","hqaddr":"999 Lake Dr.","hqcity":"Issaquah","hqstate":"WA","hqzip":"98027","hqtel":"425-313-8100","ceo":"W.

The fact that it is required now to send all of its profits to the Treasury rather than rebuilding its capital is controversial because the policy means that Fannie would have to tap the Treasury again if the market goes sour and it starts losing money once again.

The Cincinnati-based supermarket giant continued its streak in its last fiscal year, as profits jumped 18%, market share increased, and same-store sales grew 5% (excluding fuel) for the year. The fourth quarter of 2015 marked Kroger&#8217;s 49th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The 133-year-old company kept up its acquisition tear by buying the Roundy chain, giving Kroger a foothold in Wisconsin. The company has pursued a robust private label line, with about 40% of its own brand made by the company&#8217;s facilities that include dairies, delis, cheese plants, and bakeries.

The 76-year old business technology giant spent the majority of 2015 undertaking one of the most complicated corporate separations in history. Although Hewlett Packard was still a massive company with annual revenue at over $100 billion, the rise of cloud computing and the weakening personal computer and printer market took a toll on Hewlett Packard, which continued to see sales decline each quarter. To better compete in the changing marketplace, CEO Meg Whitman led the effort to split the company into two separate businesses with the idea that each could better concentrate on their own specialties and react more quickly to market changes. Additionally, the technology giant announced that it would shed over 30,000 jobs before it officially split in November 2015.

The company has spent $5.7 billion on acquisitions since 2011, including paying $1.94 billion for Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Cordis heart-product business. The deal closed ahead of schedule in late 2015. Along with the Cordis integration and a recent deal with Henry Shein, Cardinal Health will also be focused on its Red Oak venture over the next year. The 10-year split generics buying operation with <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cvs-health\/\" target=\"_blank\">CVS<\/a> is a strong earnings booster.

So far it&#8217;s off to a turbulent centennial: the company&#8217;s stock price has dropped 20% from an all-time high of nearly $160 per share in Feb. 2015. Investors are trepidatious after the company, which generates about two-thirds of its revenue from its commercial business and the rest from defense contracting, said it would deliver 740 to 745 commercial aircraft this year&#8211;less than the record 762 it delivered last year. The company also said it would lay off 4,000 workers in an effort to cut costs and that it would earn less than expected this year. Low oil prices have softened customer demand for the company&#8217;s latest and more fuel-efficient plane models, such as its costly 787 Dreamliner. Competition from rivals Airbus Group and Bombardier pose a threat to its lucrative single aisle 737 jetliner business. Meanwhile, the SEC is investigating multple years of the company&#8217;s accounting and financial filings.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1384"},"facebook":{"title":"Boeing","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Boeing on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"787 Factory Photos - Everett WA Oct. 2012\nK65770-02","credit":"Courtesy of Boeing","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/24boeing2.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/ba\/","location":"Chicago, IL","industry":"Aerospace and Defense","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"ba","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/boeingairplanes.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":586006,"name":"BOEING","slug":"ba","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":66417,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":588,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":24,"order":24,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/boeing\/","prev_rank":27,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUL5q","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/boeing\/","sort":{"rank":"24","revenues":"96114","revchange":"5.9","profits":"5176","prftchange":"-5","assets":"94408","employees":"161400","mktval":"82645"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"boeing","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"24","guid":"59","ordering":"24","hqlocation":"Chicago, IL","fullname":"The Boeing Company","revenues":"96114","revchange":"5.9","profits":"5176","prftchange":"-5","assets":"94408","totshequity":"6335","prftpctsls":"5.4","prftpctasts":"5.5","prftpctseqty":"81.7","eps":"7.44","epschange":"0.8","eps5yr":"10.8","eps10yr":"8.8","totrti":"14.1","totrti5yr":"20","totrti10yr":"10","employees":"161400","industry":"Aerospace and Defense","hqaddr":"100 N.

franchise on Windows and Office software that runs on customers&#8217; internal servers and PCs. Now Microsoft must convince them to use more Office 365, which runs in Microsoft&#8217;s own data centers, without overly cannibalizing sales of old-fashioned, on-premise Office, Exchange, and other applications. And it means convincing startups and consumers who are more into Linux or <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> to view Microsoft Azure, the company&#8217;s public cloud infrastructure, as a welcoming place for their work as well. So far, Nadella has gotten good reviews: Azure is seen as the only public cloud that can give <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> Web Services a run for its money, although it remains a distant second. And by all accounts, Office 365 has gained traction. Microsoft also hopes its year-old Windows 10 operating system will please existing Windows shops and stem defections to Apple or ChromeBook devices. And it continues to deal with fallout from the decision to buy Nokia&#8217;s phone business two years ago, which resulted in a $7.5 billion write-down last year.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4268857296001","title":"Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, on refocusing the company","author":"Fortune Video","date":"January 1, 2012","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2012\/01\/01\/satya-nadella-ceo-of-microsoft-on-refocusing-the-company\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/stay_nadella_microsoft.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"3\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4268857296001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4268857296001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1FpI7wJ\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dfortune500%2Cmicrosoft%2Csatyanadella%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dfortune500&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1035"},"facebook":{"title":"Microsoft","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Microsoft on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Microsoft Corp.

The do-it-yourself home improvement retailer has benefited from the housing recovery and people&#8217;s willingness to invest in big home projects now that they&#8217;re more confident that their homes will keep their value. Newish CEO Craig Menear has kept the momentum going, building up Home Depot&#8217;s e-commerce and expanding its private label products contractors swear by. Big-ticket items like power washers and lumber have been selling well. The only leaky faucet in its business outlook is the specter of higher interest rates that could slow housing market. Still, all signs point to continued momentum. Home Depot expects 1.9 million households will form this year, up from 1.3 million last year. And with nearly two-thirds of U.S. homes older than 30 years old, there will be need for home improvement products for a long time.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1534"},"facebook":{"title":"Home Depot","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Home Depot on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"A Home Depot employee retrieves power tools at the company's store in Torrance, California, U.S., on Friday, May 13, 2016.

Admittedly, refining margins, which expanded as crude fell, compressed again earlier in 2016, causing it to miss analysts&#8217; profit forecasts by a wide margin in the first quarter. But with U.S. gasoline demand set to rise this year, natural gas taking market share from coal in the electric power market, and with steady growth in global demand for plastics, its core businesses seem reasonably well set. On the downside, it has spent a lot of money to fit its refineries for processing (largely Canadian) heavy crude, which is at the wrong end of the global cost curve. But it has the confidence of Warren Buffett, who made it the fifth-largest holding in his portfolio at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/berkshire-hathaway\/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire Hathaway<\/a> earlier this year, and it has a strong balance sheet even after whittling away its cash pile to increase dividends and stock buybacks.

2012. Times are getting tougher now that domestic crude production is falling and that the ban on exports of U.S. crude has been lifted. After a weak first quarter earnings report for 2016, its stock hit a low that was 25% off last year&#8217;s peak. But the world&#8217;s largest independent refiner &#8212; with 15 plants processing 3 million barrels of oil a day &#8212; is still managing to churn out cash and invest in new capacity: a new crude processing unit at its Corpus Christi, Tx., plant and a catalytic cracking unit at St. Charles, La., have both come on stream in recent months and will increase its refining capacity by over 105,000 barrels per day in net terms this year.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"252536"},"facebook":{"title":"Valero Energy","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Valero Energy on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Vehicles pass a Valero Energy Corp. gas station in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Jan. 26, 2015.

The insurance and financial services firm saw net income soar to more than $2.1 billion &#8212; more than double the company&#8217;s 2014 net. State Farm has also put its backing behind several burgeoning new, and somewhat controversial, technologies in a bid to modernize the risk assessment model. For instance, the company recently became a customer of the fast-growing drone software startup Airware in order to inspect home rooftops and collect claims data from the skies. It&#8217;s also been pushing for drivers who own car insurance policies to put sensors in their vehicles so that State Farm can collect detailed driving data and assess just how much of a risk each of its individual policyholders is.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"State Farm Insurance Cos.","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"State Farm Insurance Cos. on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of State Farm","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/35statefarm.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"","location":"Bloomington, IL","industry":"Insurance: Property and Casualty (Mutual)","type":"","ticker":[],"logo":false,"term":false}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":35,"order":35,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/state-farm-insurance-cos\/","prev_rank":41,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQURtz","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/state-farm-insurance-cos\/","sort":{"rank":"35","revenues":"75697","revchange":"6.4","profits":"6229","prftchange":"48.6","assets":"241183","employees":"70425","mktval":""},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"state-farm-insurance-cos","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"35","guid":"10199","ordering":"35","hqlocation":"Bloomington, IL","fullname":"State Farm Insurance Cos.","revenues":"75697","revchange":"6.4","profits":"6229","prftchange":"48.6","assets":"241183","totshequity":"82660","prftpctsls":"8.2","prftpctasts":"2.6","prftpctseqty":"7.5","employees":"70425","industry":"Insurance: Property and Casualty (Mutual)","hqaddr":"1 State Farm Plaza","hqcity":"Bloomington","hqstate":"IL","hqzip":"61710","hqtel":"309-766-2311","ceo":"Michael L.

target=\"_blank\">Alphabet<\/a>, the company formerly known as Google, continues to forge ahead since reorganizing in August 2015. Its core unit, Google, which includes its money-printing advertising business, mobile operating system Android, and video network YouTube, remains the company&#8217;s crown jewel. In the first quarter of 2016, Alphabet&#8217;s core business generated $20.1 billion in revenue, far eclipsing the $166 million its moonshots like self-driving cars and other bets like home automation company Nest generated that quarter. Consumer products from Google are continuing to gain steam&#8211;the Google Photos service, for example, has grown to 200 million monthly active users since its debut a year earlier. The company&#8217;s lightweight Chromebook laptops recently outpaced shipments of Apple&#8217;s desktop computers in the U.S. with a total of nearly 2 million machines in this year&#8217;s first quarter, according to IDC. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Alphabet is putting its unorthodox ideas on the back burner: self-driving cars are now being tested in multiple cities and the company has announced ambitious plans for virtual reality, including headsets, a new platform, and a partnership with IMAX.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4593246317001","title":"Larry Page Talks Alphabet, Warren Buffett and Project Loon at Fortune Global Forum 2015","author":"Stephen Valdivia","date":"November 3, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/11\/03\/alphabet-larry-page-fortune-global-forum\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/11\/pag01_6.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"6\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4593246317001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4593246317001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1l5uQpL\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dalphabet%2Calphabetincvideo%2Calphabetinc%2Cfortuneglobalforum%2Cgoogle%2Clarrypage%2Clarrypagevideo%2Cmoonshots%2Cyoutube%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dfortuneglobalforum&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1441"},"facebook":{"title":"Alphabet","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Alphabet on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"A cyclist rides past Google Inc. offices inside the Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016.

The company has also been locking horns with federal regulators who believe MetLife, the nation&#8217;s largest life insurer, is &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; That scuffle has led the firm to consider spinning off its retail insurance and financial product business. However, a federal judge ruled against the government in March 2016, going on to say its designation of MetLife as TBTF is &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221; The government plans to appeal the ruling.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"2213"},"facebook":{"title":"MetLife","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"MetLife on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Cars move past the MetLife Inc. headquarters building standing behind the Helmsley Building in New York, U.S., on Monday, May 2, 2016.

Its proposed $37 billion merger with rival <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/humana\/\" target=\"_blank\">Humana<\/a> would birth a health insurance giant with dominance in the Medicare Advantage managed care space second only to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/unitedhealth-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">UnitedHealth Group<\/a> and give its pharmacy benefit unit access to patients who use more than 600 million prescriptions every year. Such a union would also transform <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/aetna\/\" target=\"_blank\">Aetna<\/a> from the primarily employer-based group insurance firm into one that focuses on individuals. The company will have to wade through significant regulatory hurdles and medical industry blowback in its quest. In May 2016, attendees at the American Hospital Association&#8217;s annual meeting warned that deals like the Aetna-Humana partnership would burden hospitals and consumers by giving insurance giants inordinate market power despite the companies&#8217; promise to make significant divestitures. State insurance commissioners like California&#8217;s Dave Jones have also expressed deep skepticism about the merger in recent months. The question of whether or not to remain in Obamacare&#8217;s individual marketplaces has also weighed heavily on insurance companies in recent months, with UnitedHealth announcing that it would exit most statewide exchanges next year. Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini has taken a different tact, arguing his firm has &#8220;an obligation to stick it out and work with it until we know that it won&#8217;t work&#8221; and may even expand its Obamacare presence (the position puts him somewhat at odds with Humana&#8217;s recent pronouncement that the firm may ditch the health law marketplaces in some states after a 46% decline in quarterly profits).<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"4618229095001","title":"Aetna CEO: \u2018Not Everybody Will Like You Every Day\u2019","author":"saralson","date":"December 8, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/12\/08\/aetna-ceo-leadership-advice\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/12\/gettyimages-111514039.jpg","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"11\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4618229095001-11\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4618229095001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1TZQ7gv\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Daetna%2Cleadershipadvice%2Cmarkbertolini%2Conleading%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Donleading&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"2807"},"facebook":{"title":"Aetna","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Aetna on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"A logo sign outside of the headquarters of Aetna, Inc., in Hartford, Connecticut on November 21, 2015.

The management shakeup highlights the tensions between the firm and its investors, including activist Carl Icahn, and the company&#8217;s desire to make big changes to mollify shareholders. The struggles may not be ending anytime soon. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/aig\/\" target=\"_blank\">AIG<\/a> announced in May that it had missed profit estimates for a third consecutive quarter, with per-share earnings 35% off consensus estimates. Part of the battering came from continued exposure to hedge funds, which have been severely under-performing as of late. That&#8217;s led AIG to announce it&#8217;s pulling about 50% of the money it has allocated to hedge funds (so far, it has removed $4 billion). The question now is, how will the firm deal with activist investors like Icahn, who now owns about a 4% stake in the company and previously called for AIG to split up into three entities, and the U.S. government, which has deemed it a &#8220;systematically important financial institution&#8221; (or &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;). AIG can take solace in a recent federal court ruling that said <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/metlife\/\" target=\"_blank\">MetLife<\/a> shouldn&#8217;t be labeled TBTF.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1760"},"facebook":{"title":"AIG","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"AIG on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"Pedestrians walk past the American International Group Inc.

Much of Humana&#8217;s prowess stems from its towering presence in the Medicare Advantage market, which represents 2.8 million of its accounts. The managed care insurance giant, which is being purchased by rival <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/aetna\/\" target=\"_blank\">Aetna<\/a> in a $37 billion deal set to close later this year, has been touting forward-looking projects such as &#8220;bundled payment&#8221; reimbursement models and a widespread initiative to boost community health in recent months. For instance, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/humana\/\" target=\"_blank\">Humana<\/a> announced an ambitious goal last year to improve the health of communities it serves through a bevy of integrated care experiments. That includes obesity reduction projects in counties like Bell County, Kentucky (among the most obese in the nation) which involve peer-to-peer counseling and nutritional education. While wellness programs&#8217; long-term effectiveness has been questioned, Humana recently reported that an 8,000-person study of its own employees showed that the HumanaVitality initiative appreciably lowered hospital visits and unscheduled absences by participants&#8211;results the firm hopes to replicate among other plan holders next year.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"4257"},"facebook":{"title":"Humana","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Humana on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Lisa J.

Long-time CEO and Silicon Valley luminary John Chambers became Cisco&#8217;s executive chairman, while Chuck Robbins, a high-ranking Cisco sales executive who Chambers once called an &#8220;execution machine,&#8221; took over as CEO. Chamber now leads a company that faces a rapidly changing technology industry in which more businesses seem to be buying less data center hardware and more cloud computing services from companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a>. The rise of the cloud has put pressure on Cisco to expand beyond its legacy networking gear business, which still brings in billions of dollars each quarter. Over the past year, Cisco has made a series of high-profile acquisitions, including a $1.4 billion dollar purchase of Internet-of-things specialist Jasper Technologies and a $635 million dollar buyout of cybersecurity startup OpenDNS. Indeed, Cisco wants to capitalize on the hot fields of cybersecurity and the Internet of things, in which devices like factory robots and elevators can be connected to the web. The technology titan has made it clear it will spend big bucks on companies to ensure it can lead in those areas. Time will tell if those mega investments will pay off.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1063"},"facebook":{"title":"Cisco Systems","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Cisco Systems on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Cisco Systems","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/54ciscosystems1.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/csco\/","location":"San Jose, CA","industry":"Network and Other Communications Equipment","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"csco","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/cisco.png?w=73","term":{"term_id":616091,"name":"CISCO SYSTEMS","slug":"csco","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":70928,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":803,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":54,"order":54,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/cisco-systems\/","prev_rank":60,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUwHA","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/cisco-systems\/","sort":{"rank":"54","revenues":"49161","revchange":"4.3","profits":"8981","prftchange":"14.4","assets":"113481","employees":"71833","mktval":"143265"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"cisco-systems","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"54","guid":"5009","ordering":"54","hqlocation":"San Jose, CA","fullname":"Cisco Systems, Inc.","revenues":"49161","revchange":"4.3","profits":"8981","prftchange":"14.4","assets":"113481","totshequity":"59698","prftpctsls":"18.3","prftpctasts":"7.9","prftpctseqty":"15","eps":"1.75","epschange":"17.4","eps5yr":"5.6","eps10yr":"7.2","totrti":"0.5","totrti5yr":"8.7","totrti10yr":"6","employees":"71833","industry":"Network and Other Communications Equipment","hqaddr":"170 W.

In early 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department scuttled its planned inversion with Ireland-based Allergan, which would have moved the Big Pharma company&#8217;s headquarters overseas. The New York-based drug maker, which benefited from its blockbuster medication Lipitor before it went off patent, was hoping to reduce its tax rate through the $150 billion deal, which would have been the largest pharmaceutical merger in history. Instead, Pfizer will have to focus on reviving its core business, which has been in decline. The company&#8217;s sales dropped 1.5% in 2015 as it still deals with the impact of patent expirations on some of its biggest drugs. Its profits, meanwhile, fell nearly 24%, largely due to a surge in acquisition-related costs, which more than quintupled from the previous year due to Pfizer&#8217;s purchase of Hospira in early 2015. Pfizer&#8217;s stock fell 14.2% in 2015, a result of its performance as well as concerns that drug price regulation could hamper its profitability.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"1185"},"facebook":{"title":"Pfizer","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Pfizer on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"The Pfizer logo sits on Viagra tablets, produced by Pfizer Inc., inside a blister pack sitting on a pharmacy counter in this arranged photograph in London, U.K., on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015.

bullish tone in February 2016 when it said organic revenue for the year would rise 4% to 5%. It stuck to that target in April despite a more modest increase of just 2% for the first three months of the year. The problem? Wall Street analysts didn&#8217;t believe the company could hit that target, and they called out Coke&#8217;s top management. Wall Street doubts Coke can hit its 2016 revenue target. That put CEO Muhtar Kent, who saw his total 2015 pay slashed by 42%, on the defense. &#8220;We are confident, definitely, in the strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the course of the year,&#8221; Kent said in April. The soda industry&#8217;s sales are facing challenges in mature markets as consumers pivot to drinks they deem healthier. And while packaged water is selling strongly and Coke has made investments in startups and even recently made a big splashy launch into the milk category, soda remains a big sales driver.

Now 20 years later, the Ingram family aims to sell its last remaining shares of Ingram Micro as the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group plans to buy the supply chain company for $6 billion. The deal, announced in February 2016, is the latest in a series of big acquisitions involving Chinese business consortiums wanting to bulk up on foreign companies and investments while China&#8217;s economy slows. After the deal closes, which is expected in the later half of 2016, Ingram Micro will become a subsidiary of Tianjin Tianhai Investment Company, itself a subsidiary of HNA Group, and its headquarters will remain in Irvine, California. HNA Group said that Ingram Micro will be the conglomerate&#8217;s biggest business in terms of revenue and will help it expand

At the start of the year, it had a network of around 71,000 miles of pipelines pumping natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil. But Warren&#8217;s luck ran out last year with a miscalculated approach for Williams Companies, just as the oil price crash took its toll on the &#8216;midstream&#8217; segment. ETE persuaded Williams to sell itself in September, but the value of both companies has tumbled since then. ETE originally agreed to pay $32.6 billion, including $6 billion in cash and the rest in ETE shares. Today, Williams is worth only $16 billion, and ETE is struggling to raise the cash after a sharp decline in its own share price. A bitter and complex legal battle has ensued. Williams, which originally refused Kelcy&#8217;s advances, is now suing to force the merger through, and to reverse an issue of convertible debt by ETE that would dilute its shareholders&#8217; stake in the combined company.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"68155"},"facebook":{"title":"Energy Transfer Equity","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Energy Transfer Equity on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Energy Transfer Equity","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/65energytransferequity1.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/ete\/","location":"Dallas, TX","industry":"Pipelines","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"ete","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/energy_transfer_logo1.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":9382221,"name":"ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY LP","slug":"ete","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":74888,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":19,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":65,"order":65,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/energy-transfer-equity\/","prev_rank":53,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUX4p","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/energy-transfer-equity\/","sort":{"rank":"65","revenues":"42126","revchange":"-24.4","profits":"1189","prftchange":"87.8","assets":"71189","employees":"30078","mktval":"7449"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"energy-transfer-equity","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"65","guid":"11380","ordering":"65","hqlocation":"Dallas, TX","fullname":"Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.","revenues":"42126","revchange":"-24.4","profits":"1189","prftchange":"87.8","assets":"71189","totshequity":"-932","prftpctsls":"2.8","prftpctasts":"1.7","eps":"1.11","epschange":"93","eps5yr":"38.9","totrti":"-50.3","totrti5yr":"12.1","employees":"30078","industry":"Pipelines","hqaddr":"8111 Westchester Dr.","hqcity":"Dallas","hqstate":"TX","hqzip":"75225","hqtel":"214-981-0700","ceo":"John W.

That combination capped the historic wave of consolidation to create the world\u2019s largest carrier. Under CEO Doug Parker, American\u2019s profits are still waxing: In the first quarter of 2016, operating income rose 9.8%, aided by an almost 30% drop in fuel costs. Still, the tailwinds that propelled American to record earnings are beginning to wane. Though Americans are still flying in record numbers, the steep fall in fuel oil prices, and the robust earnings it produced, has emboldened both major and ultra-low-cost carriers to offer a lot more seats on high-traffic routes, pushing down fares. Many of those new seats are taking flight in American\u2019s best markets. In late 2014, a ban that prevented Southwest from flying most long-haul routes from Dallas\u2019 Love Field was lifted. Since then, Southwest has be offering bargain fares to big cities from American\u2019s home market, and ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit is luring budget travelers as well, forcing American to follow suit on prices. The depression in Brazil and chaos in Venezuela are hitting its big Latin American business. In the first quarter, American\u2019s revenues slipped 4% from the same period in 2015, and its revenue for each seat flown fell 7.5%. Times are still good for American, but a new era of sustained profitability matching the recent peaks is far from certain.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"American Airlines Group","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"American Airlines Group on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"American Airlines passenger planes are seen on the tarmac at Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, June 8, 2015.

In early 2015, Cote veered from that deliberate strategy to launch a $90 billion bid for rival <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/united-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\">United Technologies<\/a>. Anti-trust issues, and complaints from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/boeing\/\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing<\/a> and Airbus, who wanted to keep both suppliers as competitors, killed the campaign. Since then, Cote has excelled at his regular practice of buying mundane-sounding industrial businesses, then strongly improving their profitability. Last year, he plowed $5.8 billion into new deals, including the purchase of German gas meter-maker Elster. He\u2019s juggling divestitures as well, unveiling a plan to spin off the resins and chemicals business.

Recently, Oracle has been buying companies that have expertise in delivering software from their own servers on a subscription basis. That&#8217;s a big change from selling databases for an upfront fee that run on customer servers and are updated every few years. But as serious as Oracle has been about adding new business software, its ace-in-the-hole remains its flagship database. Now Oracle offers more than one way to deploy it. On a March 2016 earnings call, execs said 350,000 customers run Oracle&#8217;s database in-house, but that any number may start moving some of that work to Oracle&#8217;s cloud infrastructure. The risk is that they can also run Oracle databases on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft<\/a> clouds, and that those two clouds offer other database choices.

Maxx, and HomeGoods has continued to dominate the landscape. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/tjx\/\" target=\"_blank\">TJX<\/a> sells an ever-changing assortment of branded goods at discounted prices &#8212; a formula that&#8217;s become increasingly appealing to value-oriented shoppers and has led to some copycat attempts from the likes of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/macys\/\" target=\"_blank\">Macy&#8217;s<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/nordstrom\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nordstrom<\/a>. Sales were up 6.4% for the year as the off-price retailer with more than 3,600 stores crossed the $30 billion in sales threshold, buoyed by strong performances in home goods, jewelry and accessories, and active wear. Same-store sales were up 5%, driven by higher customer traffic. The company continued its push internationally with the acquisition of Australian chain Trade Secret. E-commerce still remains an insignificant piece of the business, making up just 1% of the company&#8217;s total sales. TJX&#8217;s fiscal year ending January 30, 2016 marked the end of an era with CEO Carol Meyrowitz, who had an impressive run at the company since 2007. Earlier this year, she handed the CEO reins to Ernie Herrman, but will stay on as the company&#8217;s executive chairman for three years.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"5121"},"facebook":{"title":"TJX","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"TJX on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of TJX","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/89tjx.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/tjx\/","location":"Framingham, MA","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Apparel","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"tjx","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/tjxco.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":1057824,"name":"TJX","slug":"tjx","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":41976,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":123,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":89,"order":89,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/tjx\/","prev_rank":103,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUPSC","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/tjx\/","sort":{"rank":"89","revenues":"30945","revchange":"6.4","profits":"2278","prftchange":"2.8","assets":"11500","employees":"216000","mktval":"51914"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"tjx","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"89","guid":"2271","ordering":"89","hqlocation":"Framingham, MA","fullname":"The TJX Companies, Inc.","revenues":"30945","revchange":"6.4","profits":"2278","prftchange":"2.8","assets":"11500","totshequity":"4307","prftpctsls":"7.4","prftpctasts":"19.8","prftpctseqty":"52.9","eps":"3.33","epschange":"5.7","eps5yr":"15.1","eps10yr":"16.8","totrti":"4.6","totrti5yr":"27.6","totrti10yr":"21.3","employees":"216000","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Apparel","hqaddr":"770 Cochituate Rd.","hqcity":"Framingham","hqstate":"MA","hqzip":"1701","hqtel":"508-390-1000","ceo":"Ernie L.

Spinning off its refining and marketing operations into Phillips Petroleum has left it without a downstream hedge against low crude prices, causing a string of write-downs and quarterly losses. After a credit rating downgrade in April, CEO Ryan Lance made cutting the company&#8217;s $25 billion debt pile top priority, which suggests it won&#8217;t be heading to the bankruptcy courts with a glint in its eye in search of bargains in the shale sector. Nearly 10% of its production is bitumen, which requires expensive processing before it can be transported and sold. That means it&#8217;s squarely in harm&#8217;s way in the battle for market share being waged by low-cost OPEC producers. However, crude prices are now back above the $45 a barrel level where the company thinks it can sustain a dividend without taking on more debt.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":"3600"},"facebook":{"title":"ConocoPhillips","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"ConocoPhillips on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of ConocoPhillips","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/90conocophilips.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/cop\/","location":"Houston, TX","industry":"Mining, Crude-Oil Production","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"cop","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/conocophillips.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":86388,"name":"CONOCOPHILLIPS","slug":"cop","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":7996,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":85,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":90,"order":90,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2016\/conocophillips\/","prev_rank":51,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1WQUEa2","uri":"\/fortune500\/2016\/conocophillips\/","sort":{"rank":"90","revenues":"30935","revchange":"-44.8","profits":"-4428","prftchange":"-164.5","assets":"97484","employees":"15900","mktval":"49869"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"conocophillips","franchise_list_id":"1666518","ranking":"90","guid":"327","ordering":"90","hqlocation":"Houston, TX","fullname":"ConocoPhillips","revenues":"30935","revchange":"-44.8","profits":"-4428","prftchange":"-164.5","assets":"97484","totshequity":"39762","prftpctsls":"-14.3","prftpctasts":"-4.5","prftpctseqty":"-11.1","eps":"-3.58","epschange":"-165","totrti":"-28.8","totrti5yr":"2","totrti10yr":"4.2","employees":"15900","industry":"Mining, Crude-Oil Production","hqaddr":"600 N.

Exelon, which was born out of a merger in 2000 between Unicom and PECO, operates 23 nuclear reactors across the North-East and Midwest. These represent some 60% of its generating capacity (the rest is either fossil fuel-burning or renewable) and were the main source of its earnings until collapsing oil prices and subsidies for renewables started to undermine wholesale power prices. They&#8217;re now looking increasingly challenged: the company is threatening to close efficient nuclear plants in Illinois if local lawmakers don&#8217;t vote through a bill that would compensate them for the zero-carbon quality of their energy. The costs for nuclear decommissioning are likely to rise in the medium- to long-term, whatever the fate of the Illinois bill.

Rupert Murdoch stepped down from his role as CEO of 21st Century Fox in July, handing the reins to his son, James, while remaining executive chairman. It was an initiation by fire into the CEO role, as Fox suffered through the same late-2015 stock volatility as its Big Media rivals, thanks to market fears over the effects of cord-cutting on traditional television companies. Fox also faced a drop-off in revenue from its film unit after last year&#8217;s offerings failed to live up to the company&#8217;s blockbuster 2014. The company then kicked off the current year by offering voluntary buyouts as a means to cut $250 million from its film and TV units. The good news for Fox is that the film unit scored a surprise hit with the raunchy superhero Deadpool, while the company&#8217;s cable news networks have banked record ratings thanks to the political circus of the 2016 presidenital election cycle.<\/p>\n","videos":[{"id":"3447361285001","title":"James Murdoch on MySpace mistake","author":"Adam Lashinsky","date":"June 11, 2015","link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/video\/2015\/06\/11\/james-murdoch-on-myspace-mistake\/","thumbnail":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/murdoch.gif","video":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"16\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-3447361285001-16\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"3447361285001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1HvDTbP\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbrainstormtech%2Cjamesmurdoch%2Cmyspace%26ch%3D%26topic%3Dbrainstormtech&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>"}],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Twenty-First Century Fox","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Twenty-First Century Fox on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"BOB'S BURGERS: The Belcher family go for a drive in the snow during the holidays in the all-new Gayle Makin' Bob Sled airing Sunday, Nov. 8 (7:30-8:00 PM ET\/PT) on FOX.
