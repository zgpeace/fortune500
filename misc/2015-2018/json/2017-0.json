500","methodology":"<p>Companies are ranked by total revenues for their respective fiscal years. Included in the survey are companies that are incorporated in the U.S. and operate in the U.S. and file financial statements with a government agency. This includes private companies and cooperatives that file a 10-K or a comparable financial statement with a government agency, and mutual insurance companies that file with state regulators. It also includes companies that file with a government agency but are owned by private companies, domestic or foreign, that do not file such financial statements. Excluded are private companies not filing with a government agency; companies incorporated outside the U.S.; and U.S. companies consolidated by other companies, domestic or foreign, that file with a government agency. Also excluded are companies that failed to report full financial statements for at least three-quarters of the current fiscal year. Percent change calculations for revenue, net income, and earnings per share are based on data as originally reported. They are not restated for mergers, acquisitions, or accounting changes. The only changes to the prior years\u2019 data are for significant restatement due to reporting errors that require a company to file an amended 10-K.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Revenues are as reported, including revenues from discontinued operations when published. If a spin-off is on the list, it has not been included in discontinued operations. Revenues for commercial banks includes interest and noninterest revenues. Revenues for insurance companies include premium and annuity income, investment income, and capital gains or losses, but exclude deposits. Revenues figures for all companies include consolidated subsidiaries and exclude excise taxes. Data shown are for the fiscal year ended on or before Jan. 31, 2017. Unless otherwise noted, all figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Profits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Profits are shown after taxes, extraordinary credits or charges, cumulative effects of accounting changes, and noncontrolling interests (including subsidiary preferred dividends), but before preferred dividends of the company. Figures in parentheses indicate a loss. Profit declines of more than 100% reflect swings from 2015 profits to 2016 losses. Profits for real estate investment trusts, partnerships, and cooperatives are reported but are not comparable with those of the other companies on the list because they are not taxed on a comparable basis. Profits for mutual insurance companies are based on statutory accounting.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Balance Sheet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Assets are the company\u2019s year-end total. Total stockholders\u2019 equity is the sum of all capital stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings at the company\u2019s year-end. Excluded is equity attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also excluded is redeemable preferred stock whose redemption is either mandatory or outside the company\u2019s control. Dividends paid on such stock have been subtracted from the profit figures used in calculating return on equity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown is a fiscal year-end number as published by the company in its annual report. Where the breakdown between full- and part-time employees is supplied, a part-time employee is counted as one-half of a full-time employee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Earnings Per Share<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The figure shown for each company is the diluted earnings-per-share figure that appears on the income statement. Per-share earnings are adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends. Though earnings-per-share numbers are not marked by footnotes, if a company\u2019s profits are footnoted it can be assumed that earnings per share is affected as well. The five-year and 10-year earnings-growth rates are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Total Return to Investors<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Total return to investors includes both price appreciation and dividend yield to an investor in the company\u2019s stock. The figures shown assume sales at the end of 2016 of stock owned at the end of 2006, 2011, and 2015. It has been assumed that any proceeds from cash dividends and stock received in spin-offs were reinvested when they were paid. Returns are adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations, and corporate reorganizations as they occurred; however, no effort has been made to reflect the cost of brokerage commissions or of taxes. Total-return percentages shown are the returns received by the hypothetical investor described above. The five-year and 10-year returns are the annual rates, compounded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Medians<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No attempt has been made to calculate median figures in the tables for groups of fewer than four companies. The medians for profit changes from 2015 to 2016 do not include companies that lost money in 2015 or lost money in both 2015 and 2016, because no meaningful percentage changes can be calculated in such cases.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Credits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 Directory was prepared under the direction of list editor Scott DeCarlo. Income statement and balance sheet data provided by the companies were reviewed and verified against published earnings releases, 10-K filings, and annual reports by reporter Douglas G. Elam and accounting specialists Rhona Altschuler, and Cappy Lyons. Markets editor Kathleen Smyth used those same sources to check the data for earnings per share. In addition, we used data provided by Thomson Reuters and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence to calculate total return and market capitalization. Database administrator Santhosh Varghese provided technical support. The data verification process was aided substantially by information provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

target=\"_blank\">Cardinal Health<\/a>, a drug wholesaler that also makes gloves and surgical apparel, has been shoring up its future earnings through a series of strategic acquisitions, development of its alternate care business, and promotion of its specialty drug assets. In late 2015 the company acquired Cordis, naviHealth, and Harvard Drug; it spent much of 2016 integrating them, with a 19% increase in annual revenue to show for it. The company&#8217;s pharmaceutical segment endured ongoing profit pressures for generics and the loss of a major customer but lessened the blows with new drug launches and sales growth; its medical segment grew because of acquisitions. The partnerships and purchases are a way for Cardinal Health to snag a greater share of the medical products sold to hospitals, physicians, and ambulatory centers. The company was founded in 1979 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ohio.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Cardinal Health","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Cardinal Health on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Cardinal Health","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/cardinalhealth.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/cah\/","location":"Dublin, OH","industry":"Wholesalers: Health Care","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"cah","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/cardinalhealth.png?w=73","term":{"term_id":238748,"name":"CARDINAL HEALTH","slug":"cah","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":68263,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":33,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":15,"order":15,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2017\/cardinal-health\/","prev_rank":21,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/2qYsTTL","uri":"\/fortune500\/2017\/cardinal-health\/","sort":{"rank":"15","revenues":"121546","revchange":"18.5","profits":"1427","prftchange":"17.4","assets":"34122","mktval":"25725","employees":"37300","rankchange1000":"6","rankchange":"6"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"cardinal-health","ranking":"15","franchise_list_id":"2013055","guid":"3052","ordering":"15","prevrank":"21","fullname":"Cardinal Health, Inc.","revenues":"121546","revchange":"18.5","profits":"1427","prftchange":"17.4","assets":"34122","totshequity":"6554","prftpctsls":"1.2","prftpctasts":"4.2","prftpctseqty":"21.8","eps":"4.32","epschange":"19.3","eps5yr":"9.7","eps10yr":"6.4","totrti":"-17.7","totrti5yr":"14.5","totrti10yr":"6.4","employees":"37300","sector":"Wholesalers","industry":"Wholesalers: Health Care","hqlocation":"Dublin, OH","hqaddr":"7000 Cardinal Place","hqcity":"Dublin","hqstate":"OH","hqzip":"43017","hqtel":"614-757-5000","ceo":"George S.

target=\"_blank\">Costco<\/a> may be grappling with lower gas prices that are eating into its sales growth, but the bulk retailer still outperforms Sam&#8217;s Club every quarter, and the company posted record sales in 2016. Costco benefits from having stores in more affluent areas than Sam&#8217;s does. It also invests heavily in improvements: it spent $2.65 billion to open 33 warehouses (it now runs 715), expand its distribution and transportation systems, remodel facilities; and upgrade its IT infrastructure. One soft spot? E-commerce. Costco has lagged rivals in terms of offering online services; it now operates digital stores in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan.

The do-it-yourself home improvement chain has benefitted big time from the rebound in the housing market, which has spurred consumers to invest in their homes. The result: a year of record sales and net earnings. Same store sales, an important industry metric, were also up 5.6%. The sales growth got a boost by its 2015 purchase of Interline Brands the company&#8217;s biggest acquisition in nearly a decade. The deal gives the company more exposure to commercial markets like hospitality and healthcare, whose spending far outweighs the size of the customer base. Home Depot has still been able to attract customers to its stores in an Amazon era, but it&#8217;s investing in its digital operations. Last year 5.9% of its total sales came from online, but 45% of those purchases were picked up in store.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Home Depot","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Home Depot on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Willett Photography ","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/https-corporate-homedepot-com-sites-default-files-image_gallery-company_lumber20aisle.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/hd\/","location":"Atlanta, GA","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Other","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"hd","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/homedepot.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":62714896,"name":"HOME DEPOT","slug":"hd","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":80461,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":356,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":23,"order":23,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2017\/home-depot\/","prev_rank":28,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/2rxvO4t","uri":"\/fortune500\/2017\/home-depot\/","sort":{"rank":"23","revenues":"94595","revchange":"6.9","profits":"7957","prftchange":"13.5","assets":"42966","mktval":"176368","employees":"406000","rankchange1000":"5","rankchange":"5"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"home-depot","ranking":"23","franchise_list_id":"2013055","guid":"2968","ordering":"23","prevrank":"28","fullname":"The Home Depot, Inc.","revenues":"94595","revchange":"6.9","profits":"7957","prftchange":"13.5","assets":"42966","totshequity":"4333","prftpctsls":"8.4","prftpctasts":"18.5","prftpctseqty":"183.6","eps":"6.45","epschange":"18.1","eps5yr":"21.2","eps10yr":"8.7","totrti":"3.6","totrti5yr":"28.8","totrti10yr":"15.7","employees":"406000","sector":"Retailing","industry":"Specialty Retailers: Other","hqlocation":"Atlanta, GA","hqaddr":"2455 Paces Ferry Rd.","hqcity":"Atlanta","hqstate":"GA","hqzip":"30339","hqtel":"770-433-8211","ceo":"Craig A.

scandal dominated 2016 for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/wells-fargo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wells Fargo<\/a>, which continues to deal with the costs and fallout stemming from its aggressive sales tactics. (The company paid a $185 million fine and fired more than 5,000 employees who were found to have opened as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts for consumers. Former CEO John Stumpf also resigned in the wake of the scandal, replaced by company COO Tim Sloan.) Still, Wells Fargo grew sales almost 5% in 2016 as higher interest rates also benefited the bank, which is America&#8217;s largest retail mortgage and auto lender, with a larger loan portfolio than any of its U.S. peers. Despite the regulatory penalties, the bank&#8217;s profits fell just about 4% last year, preserving its place among the most profitable companies in the Fortune 500. Wells Fargo also recently announced plants to close more than 400 branches, following the rest of the industry&#8217;s shift away from brick-and-mortar banking in order to boost earnings.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Wells Fargo","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Wells Fargo on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"FILE - In this Sept. 21, 2016 file photo, a customer uses a Wells Fargo bank ATM in New York.

target=\"_blank\">Bank of America<\/a>, with its enormous retail banking franchise, is one of the biggest winners from rising interest rates: The company recorded its most profitable year since the financial crisis in 2016, and its second biggest profit in the history of the company. (Bank of America has yet to surpass its 2006 record, in which it earned $21 billion.) And even the Federal Reserve&#8217;s modest rate hikes have had an outsized impact on the bottom line of Bank of America, which pockets the extra interest it collects on loans while paying out much less on consumers&#8217; deposits (making money on the so-called spread). That&#8217;s a big reason why Bank of America grew profits nearly 13% last year even while sales were flat. Its stock also returned more than 33% for the year.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Bank of America Corp.","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Bank of America Corp. on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"In this Thursday, April 13, 2017, photo, a man uses a Bank of America ATM near the company's headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.

reorganizing in August 2015. Its core unit, Google, which includes its money-printing search and advertising businesses, mobile operating system Android, and video network YouTube, remains the company&#8217;s crown jewel. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Alphabet&#8217;s core business generated $26.1 billion in revenue, far eclipsing the $262 million its moonshots (like self-driving cars) and other bets (like home automation company Nest) generated in the same period. Consumer products from Google continue to push to the top. Android counts more than 2 billion monthly active users; even the Google Photos fan club has grown to 500 million since its debut two years earlier. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Alphabet is putting its unorthodox ideas on the back burner. Despite an ongoing legal battle with Uber, the company&#8217;s self-driving car unit, Waymo, is moving full steam ahead in tandem with Uber&#8217;s chief rival, Lyft. Google&#8217;s virtual reality dreams are also becoming reality. The company is building a new VR headset to follow the Daydream View and Cardboard, which was so popular that Google has shipped over 10 million of its cheap, do-it-yourself headsets since their debut in 2014.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Alphabet","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Alphabet on the Fortune 500 via

CEO Gregory Hayes, the company&#8217;s former finance chief who took the helm in late 2014, holds the distinction of being the first chief exec to strike a deal with now-President Trump after the November 2016 vote.

Despite continued worries over at sports flagship network ESPN (as well as fears over cord-cutting across the media industry), the Mouse House&#8217;s media networks booked nearly as much revenue as Disney&#8217;s parks and resorts and film studio units combined. Disneyland Shanghai finally opened its gates after years of anticipation, and the Imagineering unit has already revealed glimpses at what park-goers can expect at the promised Star Wars lands coming to Disneyland in Southern California and Walt Disney World in Florida. 2016 was an especially monster year for Disney at the box office distinguishing it from much of Hollywood as the movie studio continues to close ranks around its core franchises, such as Pixar and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney&#8217;s $4 billion bet on Lucasfilm continues to be the steal of the century as the first standalone Star Wars film, Rogue One, was one of the top-performing hits of the year even with a mid-December release date. Don&#8217;t expect the magic to fade away anytime soon.

In March the European Union approved the proposed merger, but with significant adjustments.

Where Anderson had punctuated the company&#8217;s outstanding performance metrics with sharp elbows thrown at competitors, bureaucrats, and regulators alike, Bastian has chosen a more moderate path. He has impressed employees with his personal touches, like two public apologies after a massive IT meltdown last summer and weather-related service disruptions grounded thousands of flights over a nightmarish five days this spring. One immediate benefit to Bastian&#8217;s approach is an expanded presence in key Asian markets. He successfully mended fences with Korean Air, smoothing a longstanding rift over revenue share and pricing as members of the SkyTeam Alliance. In the new relationship, the two airlines can begin selling each other&#8217;s tickets for certain flights, and in June, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/delta-air-lines\/\" target=\"_blank\">Delta<\/a> launches a new non-stop flight from Atlanta to Seoul.

operating officer. Despite failing to clinch a proposed $90 billion takeover of rival <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/united-technologies\/\" target=\"_blank\">United Technologies<\/a> last year, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/general-electric\/\" target=\"_blank\">GE<\/a> veteran Cote rode out the remnants of his reign on a generally rising stock price (excluding a temporary drop in the fall, which followed a lackluster third quarter sales report). Whether the industrial conglomerate will remain on the upswing under its new boss remains to be seen. One of Adamczyk&#8217;s first big tests will be his handling of activist investor Dan Loeb&#8217;s proposal that Honeywell spin off its aerospace unit, where margins have risen, but sales growth has

target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> became a shorthand for The Establishment during a tense presidential showdown last year, but you wouldn&#8217;t know that by the company&#8217;s post-election performance. Despite many a populist campaign trail jab, the bank has benefitted by the Trump administration, whose cabinet includes a number of Goldman alumni not least among them U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. After the ballots were counted, the company&#8217;s stock price rocketed, easing pressure on executives to cut costs. As of the publishing of this list, the bank&#8217;s stock price was still up 50% from its 2016 low around $141. Chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, back in the saddle after a cancer scare, has recently taken up Twitter, too.

target=\"_blank\">Exelon<\/a> is the country&#8217;s largest electric holding company, having closed its contentious $6.8 billion takeover of Pepco Holdings in March 2016 after months of haggling with regulators that forced it to sweeten the deal with $430 million in exceptional payments. Exelon, which was born out of a merger in 2000 between Unicom and PECO, operates 23 nuclear reactors across the Northeast and Midwest. These represent some 60% of its generating capacity (the rest is either fossil fuel-burning or renewable) and were the main source of its earnings until collapsing oil prices and subsidies for renewables started to undermine wholesale power prices. (In May 2017 for example, it announced that it would prematurely close its Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania a victim of the natural gas shale boom.) The costs for nuclear decommissioning are likely to rise in the medium- to long-term. Against this backdrop, the company is looking to source up to half of its profits from regulated businesses operating grids and serving end consumers (as with the Pepco deal), seeing these as a more stable source of income.<\/p>\n","videos":[],"links":[],"stories":[],"social":{"linkedin":{"id":""},"facebook":{"title":"Exelon","description":""},"twitter":{"description":"Exelon on the Fortune 500 via @FortuneMagazine"}},"thumbnail":{"caption":"","credit":"Courtesy of Exelon","sizes":{"company_79x79":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=79&h=79&crop=1","company_tiny":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=140&h=79&crop=1","company_list_thumb":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=134&h=75&crop=1","company_small":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=330&h=186&crop=1","company_medium":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=540&h=304&crop=1","company_large":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg?w=690&h=388&crop=1","full":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/111-exelon-supplied_utilities-crew-member-repairs-power-line-in-community.jpg"}},"people":[],"companies":[{"link":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/company\/exc\/","location":"Chicago, IL","industry":"Utilities: Gas and Electric","type":"","ticker":{"symbol":"exc","change":"","change-percent":""},"logo":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/exelon.jpg?w=73","term":{"term_id":1125041,"name":"EXELON CORP.","slug":"exc","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":75173,"taxonomy":"company","description":"","parent":0,"count":20,"filter":"raw"}}],"tags":false,"seo":{"title":""},"rank":89,"order":89,"permalink":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/2017\/exelon\/","prev_rank":95,"shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/2sPevtk","uri":"\/fortune500\/2017\/exelon\/","sort":{"rank":"89","revenues":"31360","revchange":"6.5","profits":"1134","prftchange":"-50","assets":"114904","mktval":"33309","employees":"34396","rankchange1000":"6","rankchange":"6"},"swot":{"strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[]},"meta":{"slug":"exelon","ranking":"89","franchise_list_id":"2013055","guid":"2024","ordering":"89","prevrank":"95","fullname":"Exelon Corporation","revenues":"31360","revchange":"6.5","profits":"1134","prftchange":"-50","assets":"114904","totshequity":"25837","prftpctsls":"3.6","prftpctasts":"1","prftpctseqty":"4.4","eps":"1.22","epschange":"-52","eps5yr":"-20.1","eps10yr":"-6.3","totrti":"32.6","totrti5yr":"0.4","totrti10yr":"-1.4","employees":"34396","sector":"Energy","industry":"Utilities: Gas and Electric","hqlocation":"Chicago, IL","hqaddr":"10 S.
